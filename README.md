## Installation

Right now, there isn't an official Atom package so you'll need to do the following :-

```
cd ~/.atom/packages folder
git clone https://github.com/Mpdreamz/atom-sharper.git
./build.sh or ./build.bat (on Windows this assumes that you have msbuild in your PATH)
```

Install the autocomplete-plus-async package using the Atom package manager

## To use

- Open the root of your solution within Atom
- Press Ctrl-Alt-o - this starts the OmniSharp server
- Enjoy!
